-script movement was tested
-script cameracontroller was tested ==> !!!!!Only zooming out when gets too big!!!
-script Playercontroller should be tested!!!


NOTES!!!
> script attachPickup to player? > picked up items disappear but player sizes anyway
> keep it on the pickup_holder > pickups visible after picking up, but no rigidbody or collider on them so it looks weird
> can't slowly zoom out? and zoom out doesn't work right now

> mesh colliders need to be convex to be triggered -> roll on convex meshes can be a bother (not be able to go under swing, roll on table)
	suggested fix: multiple layers of colliders (box for colliders to roll on, mesh for) -> works

> not deleting good after 10 objects?
> growing too fast? (example klimrek) > error in sizegrow Method?
> outline on everything smaller than you (pickupobject)


> Static variables stay even if you change scene?? -> sure about that?
