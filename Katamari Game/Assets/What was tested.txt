-script movement was tested
-script cameracontroller was tested ==> !!!!!Only zooming out when gets too big!!!
-script Playercontroller should be tested!!!


NOTES!!!
> script attachPickup to player? > picked up items disappear but player sizes anyway
> keep it on the pickup_holder > pickups visible after picking up, but no rigidbody or collider on them so it looks weird
> can't slowly zoom out? and zoom out doesn't work right now

> meshcoliders wont work...?
> growing too fast? (example klimrek) > error in sizegrow Method?
