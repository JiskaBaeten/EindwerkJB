*tested:

-script MovePlayer works (works with mouse, arrowkeys and numpad) > ***tweak controlls for arduino***
-script Playercontroller was tested --> why is there a speed???
-script Timer works
-script MessageReadWrite + Serial scripts work
-script ToggleOutlinePickups works > ***though it acts weird on meshes***
-script PickupObject --> works
-RolledUp Sound works!

**NOTES!!!**
> script attachPickup to player? > picked up items disappear but player sizes anyway -> nope
> keep it on the pickup_holder > pickups visible after picking up, but no rigidbody or collider on them so it looks weird

> can't slowly zoom out? and zoom out doesn't work right now

> mesh colliders need to be convex to be triggered -> roll on convex meshes can be a bother (not be able to go under swing, roll on table)
	suggested fix: multiple layers of colliders (box for colliders to roll on, mesh for) -> works

> growing too fast? (example klimrek) > error in sizegrow Method?

> outline on everything smaller than you (pickupobject)

> Static variables stay even if you change scene?? -> sure about that?

> [Serialize] can be used to set private variables in inspector and to save/store variables

> unity werken met radialen, dus --> overstaande zijde = schuinliggende / Mathf.Sin(hoek * Mathf.Deg2Rad)
