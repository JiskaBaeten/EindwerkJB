make list of when to zoomout (numbers of sizes)
when triggered, delete current number from list, make new number be the next trigger


might need coroutine for slowly zooming out since Lerp works per frame and if it's only done once -> no effect

ex:
 function LerpFoV(fov : float) {
     // lerping a value in this way may take quite some time to reach the exact target value, so we will just stop lerping when the difference is small enough, i.e 0.05
     var dif : float = Mathf.Abs(Camera.main.fieldOfView - fov);
 
     while(dif > 0.05) {
         Mathf.Lerp(Camera.main.fieldOfView, fov, 0.1);
         // update the difference 
         dif = Mathf.Abs(Camera.main.fieldOfView - fov);
         yield;
     }
 }
 
 // start the coroutine
 StartCoroutine(LerpFoV(100));
