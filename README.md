# EindwerkJB

My 'thesis' revolves around the game Katamari.
Inspired by a Dung Beetle, trying to get revenge on the human that destroyed its previous dung ball.
This beetle won't stop till it has rolled up the human's house.

A special mouse that can help with playing the game, will be developed in real life (hopefully).
The style of the game will be rather realistic with cartoony elements.
All made with the help of Unity3D, Cinema4D and Arduino.
